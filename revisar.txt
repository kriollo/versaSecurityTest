Add unit tests for the following cases:
1. AuthenticationTest correctly identifies insecure HTTP for credentials and detects forms without autocomplete="off".
2. DataIntegrityTest accurately identifies insecure PHP deserialization patterns in cookies.
3. PortScanTest successfully extracts host from URLs and identifies common open ports, flagging insecure services.
4. OutdatedComponentsTest correctly extracts software versions from HTTP headers and detects known software fingerprints by path.
5. AdvancedSQLInjectionTest detects error-based, time-based, and boolean-based blind SQL injection vulnerabilities.
